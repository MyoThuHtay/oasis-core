go/runtime/registry: Fix key manager (quote) policy updates

When a key manager (quote) policy update fails, the host should retry the
update until the policy is updated. For example, when using Tendermint as
a backend service, the first update will always fail because the consensus
verifier sees new blocks with a one-block delay.
