go/staking/api: Add BurnAddress

Transfers to `oasis1qzq8u7xs328puu2jy524w3fygzs63rv3u5967970` will be
treated as an explicit token burn (transfer amount deducted from the
source's general balance and destroyed).

The private key of the address is unknown, and the address is marked
as reserved so the address can not be used as the source address for
any transactions.
